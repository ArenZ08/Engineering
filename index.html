 <h4>Today we learnt eachothers name and found out one fun fact about them.</h3>
 <p>
 Some people knew everyone's name and found the activity very easy.<br> Others found it
 difficult to keep track of everyone's names. For me though, it was very simple.

 </p>This week was a fun week with many new things implemented. <br> We satrted off with
 tinkercad and making the Rube Goldberg machine. <br> It was complicated at first but I figured it out.
 Then on Friday, we did the challenge. <br> we had to bring an object from school and 
 tinkercad it. Mine was bad because I chose a very difficult object.
